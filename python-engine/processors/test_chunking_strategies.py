Test script for Chunking Strategies

This script tests all chunking strategies including:
- Fixed-size chunking with boundary detection
- Semantic chunking (when available)
- Hierarchical chunking with structure preservation
- Spiritual text chunking with domain-specific logic
- Chunk quality assessment and post-processing
