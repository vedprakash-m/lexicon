# Development Progress Summary - June 26, 2025

## 🎯 Today's Accomplishments

### ✅ Completed: Caching System Implementation (`caching-system` task)

**What was built:**
1. **Backend Cache Manager** (`src-tauri/src/cache_manager.rs`)
   - Intelligent LRU cache with configurable size and entry limits
   - TTL-based expiration with automatic cleanup
   - HTTP response and file content caching
   - SHA256-based cache key generation
   - Comprehensive statistics tracking (hit ratio, memory usage, evictions)
   - Background cleanup task for expired entries

2. **Backend Commands** (`src-tauri/src/cache_commands.rs`)
   - Full Tauri command interface for frontend integration
   - Cache configuration updates and statistics retrieval
   - Performance recommendations based on usage patterns
   - Metrics export functionality
   - URL and file caching commands

3. **Frontend Cache Manager** (`src/components/cache/CacheManager.tsx`)
   - Comprehensive React UI with tabbed interface
   - Real-time statistics dashboard with performance indicators
   - Configuration panel with switches and inputs
   - Visual progress bars for memory and entry usage
   - Performance recommendations display
   - Metrics export functionality

4. **Integration Updates**
   - Updated `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` to include cache manager
   - Added SHA2 dependency to `Cargo.toml`
   - Created component exports in `src/components/cache/index.ts`

**Key Features Implemented:**
- 🔄 LRU eviction strategy with configurable limits
- ⏱️ TTL-based expiration with automatic cleanup
- 📊 Real-time performance monitoring and statistics
- 🎛️ Dynamic configuration updates
- 📈 Performance recommendations engine
- 💾 HTTP response and file content caching
- 🧹 Background cleanup tasks
- 📁 Metrics export for analysis

## 📋 Tomorrow's Priorities

### 1. Advanced UI Features Implementation (`advanced-ui-features` task)
**Acceptance Criteria to implement:**
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts system
- [ ] Tooltips and contextual help
- [ ] Command palette for quick navigation
- [ ] Enhanced navigation patterns

**Files to create/modify:**
- `src/components/ui/KeyboardShortcuts.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/Tooltip.tsx`  
- `src/components/ui/CommandPalette.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/HelpSystem.tsx`
- Update `src/components/ui/index.ts`
- Update navigation and layout components

### 2. Add Cache Management to Navigation
**Files to modify:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Add cache route
- `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` - Add cache navigation item

### 3. Test Cache Integration
- Build and test the cache system
- Verify frontend-backend integration
- Test cache performance and cleanup

## 🛠️ Technical Notes for Tomorrow

### Build Dependencies
- Ensure SHA2 dependency is properly integrated
- Verify all Tauri commands are exported correctly
- Check React component imports and exports

### Integration Points
- Cache manager needs to be added to main navigation
- Consider integrating cache warmup with existing scrapers
- Link cache performance to overall system performance monitoring

### Testing Priorities
1. Cache eviction under memory pressure
2. TTL expiration and cleanup
3. Configuration updates and persistence
4. Frontend statistics updates
5. HTTP and file caching effectiveness

## 📊 Key Metrics & Status
