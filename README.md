# Lexicon

> **Universal RAG Dataset Preparation Tool for Any Text Content**

Lexicon is a native macOS application designed for developers, researchers, content creators, analysts, and professionals who need high-quality RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) datasets from any text content. Built with modern technologies, Lexicon provides a comprehensive solution for processing technical documentation, academic papers, business documents, literature, legal texts, medical content, educational materials, web content, religious texts, and any structured text.

> **Note**: Lexicon is currently in active development. Core processing capabilities are implemented and tested, with the user interface and integration features being refined for production release.
