## ÔøΩÔ∏è Troubleshooting

### "Lexicon is damaged and can't be opened" Error

This is a common macOS security message for unsigned applications. **The app is not actually damaged.**

**Solution 1 - Remove Quarantine Attribute (Most Effective):**
1. Open **Terminal** (found in Applications ‚Üí Utilities)
2. Run this command (copy and paste exactly):
   ```bash
   sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Lexicon.app
   ```
3. Enter your Mac password when prompted
4. Try opening Lexicon normally - it should now work

**Solution 2 - Right-click to Open:**
1. Right-click (or Control+click) on Lexicon.app in Applications
2. Select "Open" from the context menu
3. Click "Open" in the security dialog
4. If this still shows the "damaged" error, use Solution 1 above

**Solution 3 - Security & Privacy Settings:**
1. Try to open the app normally (to trigger the security message)
2. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí General
3. Click "Open Anyway" next to the Lexicon message
4. Click "Open" in the confirmation dialog
5. If no "Open Anyway" button appears, use Solution 1 above

**Solution 4 - Automated Fix Script:**
Download and run our automated fix script:
1. Download: [fix-lexicon-macos.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vedprakash-m/lexicon/main/scripts/fix-lexicon-macos.sh)
2. Open Terminal and run: `chmod +x ~/Downloads/fix-lexicon-macos.sh`
3. Run the script: `~/Downloads/fix-lexicon-macos.sh`
4. Enter your password when prompted

**Solution 5 - Download from Different Location:**
If the above don't work, the download may be corrupted:
1. Delete the current Lexicon.app from Applications
2. Re-download from GitHub releases page
3. Use Solution 1 immediately after downloading

**Why this happens:**
- The app is not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate
- macOS Gatekeeper blocks unsigned apps by default
- This is a security feature, not an actual problem with the app

### Other Common Issues

**App won't start:**
- Ensure you're running macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- Check that you have sufficient disk space (100MB minimum)
- Try restarting your Mac and opening the app again

**Python engine errors:**
- The app includes all Python dependencies - no separate installation needed
- If you see Python-related errors, try reinstalling the app

## ÔøΩüîß System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **OS**: macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- **Architecture**: Intel x64 or Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) 
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 100MB for application, additional space for processed datasets
- **Network**: Internet connection for cloud sync features (optional)

### Development Requirements  
- **Node.js**: 18.0+ with npm package manager
