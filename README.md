## ÔøΩÔ∏è Troubleshooting

### "Lexicon is damaged and can't be opened" Error

This is a common macOS security message for unsigned applications. **The app is not actually damaged.**

**Solution 1 - Right-click to Open:**
1. Right-click (or Control+click) on Lexicon.app in Applications
2. Select "Open" from the context menu
3. Click "Open" in the security dialog
4. App will launch and be trusted permanently

**Solution 2 - Security & Privacy Settings:**
1. Try to open the app normally (to trigger the security message)
2. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí General
3. Click "Open Anyway" next to the Lexicon message
4. Click "Open" in the confirmation dialog

**Why this happens:**
- The app is not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate
- macOS Gatekeeper blocks unsigned apps by default
- This is a security feature, not an actual problem with the app

### Other Common Issues

**App won't start:**
- Ensure you're running macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- Check that you have sufficient disk space (100MB minimum)
- Try restarting your Mac and opening the app again

**Python engine errors:**
- The app includes all Python dependencies - no separate installation needed
- If you see Python-related errors, try reinstalling the app

## ÔøΩüîß System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **OS**: macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- **Architecture**: Intel x64 or Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) 
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 100MB for application, additional space for processed datasets
- **Network**: Internet connection for cloud sync features (optional)

### Development Requirements  
- **Node.js**: 18.0+ with npm package manager
- **Python**: 3.9+ with pip package manager
