## Configuration and Customization

### Tour Configuration
Tours are easily configurable through the `TOURS` object in `FeatureTour.tsx`:
```typescript
const TOURS = {
  'tour-id': [
    {
      id: 'step-id',
      title: 'Step Title',
      content: 'Step description',
      target: '[data-tour="element-id"]',
      position: 'top' | 'bottom' | 'left' | 'right',
      action: 'click' | 'hover' | 'type',
      required: boolean,
      highlight: boolean
    }
  ]
}
```

### Sample Project Templates
New sample projects can be added to the `SAMPLE_PROJECTS` array with:
