### Implementation Gaps Identified

#### **Frontend Layer Issues**
- **Dashboard**: All statistics hardcoded (0 books, 0 processing, etc.)
- **Error Handling**: Mix of proper toasts and legacy alert() calls
- **Book Management**: Cover images fallback to non-existent placeholder endpoint
- **Search**: Basic functionality only, no semantic or advanced filtering
- **Processing Status**: Shows static "No Active Processing" instead of real data

#### **Backend Layer Issues**
- **Performance Monitor**: Placeholder values for CPU, memory, disk metrics
- **State Management**: Hardcoded chunk counts and statistics
- **Processing Integration**: Python-Rust integration incomplete
- **File Upload**: Basic functionality works but error handling inadequate

#### **Integration Layer Issues**
- **Cloud Sync**: UI components exist but no actual sync implementation
- **Third-party APIs**: Google Books/Open Library mentioned but not integrated
- **Native Features**: Limited macOS-specific functionality
- **Security**: No encryption or access control implementation

### Current Capabilities vs. Production Requirements
### Current Capabilities vs. Production Requirements
