- **Error Handling**: Mix of proper toasts and legacy alert() calls
- **Book Management**: Cover images fallback to non-existent placeholder endpoint
- **Search**: Basic functionality only, no semantic or advanced filtering
- **Processing Status**: Shows static "No Active Processing" instead of real data

#### **Backend Layer Issues**
- **Performance Monitor**: Placeholder values for CPU, memory, disk metrics
- **State Management**: Hardcoded chunk counts and statistics
- **Processing Integration**: Python-Rust integration incomplete
- **File Upload**: Basic functionality works but error handling inadequate

#### **Integration Layer Issues**
- **Cloud Sync**: UI components exist but no actual sync implementation
- **Third-party APIs**: Google Books/Open Library mentioned but not integrated
- **Native Features**: Limited macOS-specific functionality
- **Security**: No encryption or access control implementation

### Current Capabilities vs. Production Requirements
### Current Capabilities vs. Production Requirements

#### Critical Production Issues Identified (July 19, 2025)
**🚨 HIGH PRIORITY BUG FIXES - USER TESTING FEEDBACK**

Following user testing of the latest production candidate, critical data persistence and workflow issues discovered:

**Issue #1: Book Upload Data Flow Broken** � **MAJOR PROGRESS**
- **Symptom**: Upload shows "Successfully added 1 book" but book doesn't appear in Book Catalog
- **Root Cause IDENTIFIED**: SourceText (upload) → BookMetadata (catalog) conversion missing, CatalogManager.get_all_books() hardcoded to return empty vec![]
- **Impact**: Critical - core functionality completely non-functional
- **Status**: � **CORE FIX IMPLEMENTED** - Testing in progress
- **Technical Solution**: Refactored catalog database integration, implemented SourceText→BookMetadata mapping, fixed all compilation errors
- **Testing**: Dev server building to verify end-to-end upload→display flow

**Issue #2: Notification Persistence Failure** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Symptom**: Notifications marked as "Read" revert to "Unread" on page navigation
- **Root Cause**: Notification state not persisting to backend/database
- **Impact**: High - user experience severely degraded
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED (07/20/2025) - Implemented localStorage persistence for notification state
- **Fix**: Replaced useState-only notification system with localStorage-backed persistence in useNotifications hook

**Issue #3: Project Data Persistence Failure** 🚨
- **Symptom**: Created projects disappear after navigation (Literature project vanishes)
- **Root Cause**: Project persistence layer completely non-functional
- **Impact**: Critical - core workflow broken, users cannot save work
- **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED WORKING - Project persistence through localStorage confirmed functional in ProjectManagement.tsx**Issue #4: Performance Monitoring Data Inconsistencies** 🚨 **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**
- **Symptom**: Multiple performance monitoring inconsistencies detected:
  - CPU utilization shows 0% in one location, 12% in another (both likely incorrect)
  - Memory usage displays 0.0 MB (clearly incorrect)
  - Uptime shows static "2hr 14m" value that never changes
- **Root Cause IDENTIFIED**: Performance monitoring system appears to be using hardcoded/placeholder values
- **Impact**: High - users cannot trust system monitoring data, potential performance issues hidden
- **Status**: ✅ **CORE FIXES IMPLEMENTED** - Testing in progress
- **Technical Solution**: 
  - Fixed PerformanceMonitor never being started in lib.rs - added `start_monitoring().await` call
  - Replaced hardcoded StatusBar values with real performance data from usePerformanceMonitor hook  
  - Connected StatusBar CPU, uptime, and memory values to actual backend metrics
  - All code compiles successfully, testing via development server
- **Testing**: 🧪 Development server starting to verify real-time performance metrics display

**Issue #5: Duplicate Book Handling Missing** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Symptom**: Same book can be uploaded multiple times, creating duplicate entries with identical metadata
- **Root Cause**: No duplicate detection mechanism in upload pipeline
- **Impact**: High - library becomes cluttered with duplicates, data integrity compromised
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Multi-method duplicate detection system complete
- **Technical Solution Implemented**: 
  - ✅ Added `check_for_duplicates` function with SHA256 checksum comparison (100% confidence)
  - ✅ Implemented ISBN-based duplicate detection (95% confidence)
  - ✅ Added title + author combination matching (90% confidence)
  - ✅ Created `DuplicateCheckResult` struct for comprehensive duplicate information
  - ✅ Integrated with existing database checksum field in SourceText model
  - ✅ Added Tauri command `check_for_duplicates` for frontend integration

**Issue #6: Missing Book Management Operations** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Symptom**: No way to delete books from catalog or remove from collections after upload
- **Root Cause**: Delete functionality not implemented in catalog management system
- **Impact**: Critical - users cannot manage their library, no way to clean up mistakes
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Complete delete functionality with file cleanup
- **Technical Solution Implemented**: 
  - ✅ Added `delete_book` function with comprehensive cleanup (database + files)
  - ✅ Integrated with existing repository delete method for database operations
  - ✅ Added FileSystem integration for associated file deletion
  - ✅ Implemented cascading cleanup of FTS index entries
  - ✅ Created `DeleteResult` struct for detailed operation feedback
  - ✅ Added Tauri command `delete_book` for frontend integration
  - ✅ Added proper error handling and rollback capabilities

**Issue #7: Sidebar Navigation Book Count Inconsistency** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Symptom**: Dashboard/catalog shows books are present, but left sidebar navigation displays "All Books: 0" 
- **Root Cause**: AppSidebar component used hardcoded "count: 0" values while real book data was available in useCatalogManager hook but not connected
- **Impact**: High - creates user confusion about actual library contents, navigation becomes unreliable
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Sidebar counts now sync with real catalog data
- **Resolution Applied**: 
  - Integrated useCatalogManager hook into AppSidebar component
  - Moved sidebarItems array inside component to access dynamic data
  - Implemented real-time book count calculation with useMemo
  - Updated "All Books", "In Progress", "Completed" counts to use actual catalog data
  - Added processing queue count from sidebarStatus 
  - Maintained performance with proper memoization
- **Result**: Sidebar navigation now displays accurate book counts that sync with catalog dashboard data

**Analysis Priority:**
1. ✅ **Book Management CRUD Operations** - Delete functionality and duplicate detection COMPLETED
2. ✅ **Sidebar Navigation Data Sync** - Fix book count inconsistencies COMPLETED
3. **Performance Monitoring Verification** - Confirm real metrics display correctly (IN TESTING)
4. **Data Persistence Layer Audit** - Check if Zustand persistence is working with Tauri backend
5. **Database Integration Verification** - Confirm all CRUD operations actually reach database
6. **State Management Flow** - Trace data flow from UI actions to backend storage
7. **Backend Command Verification** - Ensure Tauri commands are properly implemented and called
