## Risk Management & Contingencies

### Technical Risks

1. **Python-Rust Integration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Difficult inter-process communication
   - **Mitigation**: Prototype early, consider alternatives like PyO3
   - **Contingency**: Fallback to separate Python service

2. **Web Scraping Stability**
   - **Risk**: Website changes breaking scrapers
   - **Mitigation**: Robust error handling, flexible selectors
   - **Contingency**: Manual data import options

3. **Performance Issues**
   - **Risk**: Slow processing of large texts
   - **Mitigation**: Streaming processing, background tasks
   - **Contingency**: Chunk processing, progress indicators

### Schedule Risks

1. **Feature Scope Creep**
   - **Risk**: Adding features beyond MVP
   - **Mitigation**: Strict scope management, phase-based delivery
   - **Contingency**: Defer non-critical features to future versions

2. **Integration Delays**
   - **Risk**: Complex integrations taking longer than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Early prototyping, parallel development
   - **Contingency**: Simplified integration patterns
